            <h1>Values</h1>
            <h4>Working in government can be challenging, and our values help us stay aligned on what’s most important. We foster these values on our teams and we look for them in our applicants, vendors, and collaborators.</h4>
          </div>

        <div class="row values-list">

            <div class="col-sm">
              <h4 class="value">Open by default.</h4>
              <p>Hard problems are solved through collaboration and diverse community. We use and build open source code by default, and actively share our learnings and methods through lunch-and-learns, meetups, and Medium.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Frame the problem first.</h4>
              <p>The core problems in an issue area are often unclear, especially early on in a project. We take time to understand what needs to be solved before coming up with solutions.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Everyone has positive intent.</h4>
              <p>Communication is hard.  By assuming our peers want what is best, we believe we can find the best in them.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Strong opinions, loosely held. </h4>
              <p>It’s important to have confidence and passion in our arguments. It’s also important to consider that you might be wrong, and to be honest and respectful in all disagreements. We work from an understanding that everyone has different, though complementary, problem solving styles. </p>

              <h4 class="value">Balance short-term wins and long-term outcomes.</h4>
              <p>We believe that every technical decision has alternative solutions and we must balance between shipping quickly and shipping cautiously. We think through long-term possibilities, opportunities, and consequences for our short-term goals.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col-sm">

              <h4 class="value">Default to action.</h4>
              <p>We believe in the cycle of Learning and Doing to move projects and ideas forward. Sometimes the best way to learn about a problem is to test out possible solutions.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Ask for help.</h4>
              <p>We’re funded by taxpayers, so it’s <u>not</u> ok to &#34;fake it till you make it.&#34; If you don’t understand a process, method, or idea, ask for help. Everyone has their own talents, skills, and knowledge, and no one benefits if we don’t allow ourselves to share them.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Everyone has something to teach. </h4>
              <p>We believe that teaching compassionately helps us learn. We all have room to grow across many types of skills. We believe our team members aren’t expected to know everything, and we support them when they are stuck.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Learning is ongoing.</h4>
              <p>We believe that passionate curiosity drives exceptional work. Even experts have something to learn.</p>

              <h4 class="value">Work should be fun.</h4>
              <p>The best work comes from a place of curiosity, passion, and joy. We take time support each other in doing great work for residents and being our fullest possible selves inside and outside of the office. </p>
